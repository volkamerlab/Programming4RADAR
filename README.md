# Programming4RADAR

This repository contains notebooks for the ML workshop of the RADAR general assembly in January 2026. Due to time constraints, we do not include a Python or Jupyter introduction. However, if you are interested, you can find a Python/Jupyter introduction in our [repo with the workshop material of the AI in Chemistry conference 2025](https://github.com/volkamerlab/ai_in_chemistry_workshop_2025/tree/main/Intro_Session).

This repository contains **Jupyter Notebooks** (.ipynb) designed to be run using Google Colab. No local installation is required.

### Quick start: How to run the jupyter notebook using Google Colab

1. Open Google Colab: [https://colab.research.google.com/](https://colab.research.google.com/)
2. Click GitHub
3. Enter this repository, i.e., [https://github.com/volkamerlab/Programming4RADAR](https://github.com/volkamerlab/Programming4RADAR), in the search field.
4. Select the starting notebook by clicking on ``intro_supervised_ML.ipynb``.

### Notebook Basics

A Jupyter Notebook is made up of **cells**. The two main types used in this repository are:

#### Code Cells
- Contain **Python code** in our examples
- Used for computation, data processing, and visualizations
- Produce output when executed (e.g., text, tables, plots), e.g., press Shift + Enter to run the cell

Example:
```python
print("Hello, world!")
```

#### Markdown Cells
- Contain formatted text such as headings, explanations, lists, links, and equations
- Used to explain what the code is doing
- Do not execute Python code
- Markdown cells support simple formatting like:
  - ''#'' for headings
  - **bold** and *italic*
  - Bullet points and numbered lists
