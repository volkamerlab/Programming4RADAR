    "Machine learning (ML) is a research area in computer science, where algorithms are developed to learn from data. Generally, ML can be subdivided into four major realms: (i) supervised learning, (ii) unsupervised learning, (iii) semi-supervised learning, and (iv) reinforcement learning. In this notebook, we focus on supervised ML. In supervised ML, an algorithm learns to predict a specific *response* (e.g., toxicity) for a sample (e.g., compound) based on *features* of the sample (e.g., physicochemical propteries). The learning is based on the assumption that there is a functional relationship between the features and the response, which we can approximate. There exist a plethora of different algorithms, which mainly differ in their assumptions about the true relationship and their learning algorithm, i.e., how they approximate the true function. In this tutorial we will start with linear regression, which assumes a linear relationship between the features and the response."

    "### Data\n",
    "As mentioned above, the dataset must consist of *features*, i.e., descriptors of the samples, and a *response*, i.e., a measurement that we want to predict. The goal is to learn a relationship between the features and the response for a given *training set* of samples so that we can later predict for *unseen* samples. In particular, we always separate a hold out *test set*, which is used to evaluate how well our model predicts for samples that it has not seen during training.\n",

    "The most important step in the ML pipeline is the data processing. In the following, we first download the [AqSolDB dataset](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41597-019-0151-1) from our GitHub, as this is our toy dataset for this tutorial."

    "As already mentioned above, we need two disjoint sets for training and for testing. Typically, the training set accounts for ~80% of the original dataset, while the remaining 20% are used for testing. The most easy way to split the data is to split the compounds randomly. However, as we want the model to generalize well across the chemical space, we make sure that similar compounds will be in the same set. To this end, we use a software called [`datasail`](https://datasail.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) that calculates the distance between the molecular fingerprints and splits the data so that the distance between the two sets is maximized."

To better understand its decisions, we now analyse the importance of the different features (i.e., physchem properties) for our prediciton. To this end, we use [shapley values](https://shap.readthedocs.io/en/latest/example_notebooks/overviews/An%20introduction%20to%20explainable%20AI%20with%20Shapley%20values.html) that measure the feature importance on the test set."

    "When working with ML models, we always have parameters that we have to adjust based on the given data, e.g., for the linear model we adjusted the slope and the y-intercept. When having more complex models there are also so-called hyperparameters, which are the parameters that already define parts of the model, e.g., the number of trees in a random forest. The hyperparameters have to be selected before training, but ideally we would like to select them based on the data. Therefore, we use a method called k-fold CV, where we split the training set into k parts and in each of the k iterations, we use another part for testing and the remaining k-1 parts for training. By this we can already estimate the error on the real test set and make informed decisions without leaking information from the test set."
