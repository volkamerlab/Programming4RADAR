# Programming4RADAR

This repository contains notebooks for the ML workshop of the RADAR general assembly in January 2026. Due to time constraints, we do not include a Python or Jupyter introduction. However, if you are interested, you can find a Python/Jupyter introduction in our [repo with the workshop material of the AI in Chemistry conference 2025](https://github.com/volkamerlab/ai_in_chemistry_workshop_2025/tree/main/Intro_Session).

## Quick start: How to run the jupyter notebook using Google Colab
